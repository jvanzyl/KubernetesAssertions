# Kubernetes Assertions
A forked version of fabric8's [kubernetes-assertions](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/components/kubernetes-assertions/)
 component.
 
 ## Why we forked?
 The project had an older version of assertJ as well as didn't have any Unit Tests. We've upgraded the project to use assertJ 3.8.0 to provide the latest features as well as added Test Cases. It will be continuously maintained by us in the future.
